Hello and Welcome. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/99053207-6947-453d-accd-9ab18e9c51ea.jpg)

My name is Eric and I would like to tell you about me. Why else would I have a website for myself? I think it's because I want the old self to speak to my future self. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/98eeffd0-25bb-49d4-8bfd-2bdf0c394f5c.jpg)
